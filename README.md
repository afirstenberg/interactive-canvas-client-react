# React and the Google Assistant Interactive Canvas

This project was demonstrated at the Voice Lunch Developers session on
Feb 25th 2021.

It was bootstrapped from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
and still maintains many legacies that I didn't bother to delete. I'll focus
on what is done specifically for the Interactive Canvas.
